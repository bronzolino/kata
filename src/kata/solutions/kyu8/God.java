/**
 * Basic subclasses - Adam and Eve 8 KYU
 * 
 * According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eva were
 * the first Humans to wander the earth.
 * 
 * You have to do Godâ€™s job. The creation method must return an array of length
 * 2 containing objects representing Adam and Eva. The first object in the array
 * should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of
 * the class Woman. Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to
 * implement the Human, Man and Woman classes.
