 * DNA to RNA Conversion 8 KYU
 * 
 * Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in
 * biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'),
 * Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').
 * 
 * Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA
 * differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In
 * RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').
 * 
 * Create a funciton which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
